                                    Not all retailers are created equal. In some cases when you purchase from an on-line retailer only the order information is made 
                                    available by the store and it is difficult for Linc to obtain your tracking information. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>If you find this is happening too often please let Linc know 
                                    and we will do our best to work with the store directly to improve the experience and access to information.
